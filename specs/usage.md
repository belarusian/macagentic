# Model Usage

macAgentic uses LiteLLM's native Responses API model. Every successful model
call contributes to cumulative session usage, including intermediate calls in
tool loops.

Usage tracks the provider-reported total input, cached input, cache writes,
output, and calculated USD cost. Cached input and cache writes are details of
input processing; they are not added to the input total. Missing provider
details count as zero.

In terminal mode, cumulative process usage is printed after each model call.
When stdout is a terminal, labels and values may be colored; redirected output
and `NO_COLOR` use this exact plain-text form:

```text
Usage  Input: 12,345  Cached: 8,192  Writes: 4,096  Output: 1,024  Cost: $0.65
```

In UI mode, the top-right status shows cumulative usage for the active tab:

```text
gpt-5.6-terra / $0.65
Input: 12,345 / Cached: 8,192
Writes: 4,096 / Output: 1,024
```

Usage is session-only metadata. It is never written to the Markdown transcript.
